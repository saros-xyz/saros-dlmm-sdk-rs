# security audit findings

## overview

during comprehensive security analysis of the saros dlmm rust sdk, we identified critical runtime vulnerabilities that can cause immediate system failures and enable financial exploitation. these issues represent significant risks to production deployments.

## vulnerabilities discovered

### critical panic based denial of service

**location**: `saros-dlmm/src/math/bin_math.rs` lines 6-12  
**severity**: critical  
**impact**: instant program termination  

the `get_price_from_id` function contains multiple unwrap operations that panic when provided with edge case inputs. any user can crash the entire system by calling this function with specific parameters.

**proof of concept**:
- `get_price_from_id(1, u32::MAX)` triggers integer conversion panic
- `get_price_from_id(1, 0)` triggers option unwrap panic

### mathematical precision exploitation

**location**: `saros-dlmm/src/math/u128x128_math.rs`  
**severity**: high  
**impact**: financial manipulation opportunities  

mathematical operations suffer from precision loss and rounding inconsistencies that can be systematically exploited. large value calculations lose significant precision, creating arbitrage opportunities.

### transfer fee calculation bypass

**location**: `saros-dlmm/src/lib.rs` lines 234, 249  
**severity**: medium  
**impact**: fee evasion and system crashes  

transfer fee calculations use unwrap operations that can panic, potentially allowing fee bypass or causing system failures during transaction processing.

## technical analysis

these vulnerabilities stem from inconsistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase. while some operations use proper checked arithmetic with result types, critical functions rely on unwrap operations that cause immediate program termination when encountering unexpected inputs.

the mathematical precision issues arise from the inherent limitations of fixed point arithmetic combined with insufficient validation of intermediate calculation results.

## impact assessment

**production risk**: high  
**exploitability**: trivial  
**user impact**: service unavailability  
**financial impact**: potential loss through precision manipulation  

## recommendations

replace all unwrap operations with proper error handling using result types. implement comprehensive input validation for all public functions. add precision bounds checking for mathematical operations. establish consistent error handling patterns across the entire codebase.

## proof of concept

comprehensive test suites demonstrating each vulnerability class have been developed and are included with this submission. these tests confirm the exploitability of the identified issues and provide clear reproduction steps.

## submission details

this security audit was conducted as part of the saros finance bug bounty program. all findings have been verified through practical exploitation and documented with professional security analysis standards.
