Summary of Changes
I've successfully fixed the 3 most critical issues identified in the saros-dlmm-sdk-rs.md file:

1. Fixed the Missing 
get_swap_and_account_metas
 Function Implementation
Issue: The function had unimplemented!(); which caused the program to crash when called
Fix: Implemented the function to properly return SwapAndAccountMetas with the correct swap type and account metadata
File: 
saros-dlmm/src/lib.rs
 (lines 315-318)
2. Fixed Fee Calculation Panic
Issue: The 
quote
 function used unwrap() on 
compute_transfer_fee
 which could cause the program to panic
Fix: Replaced unwrap() with proper error propagation using the ? operator
File: 
saros-dlmm/src/lib.rs
 (lines 234 and 249)
3. Improved Dependency Management
Issue: The workspace used Rust edition 2024 (unstable) and some dependencies used version ranges
Fix: Updated to stable Rust edition 2021 and specified exact dependency versions
File: 
Cargo.toml
 (lines 7, 13-17, 18, 20, 22-23)
