# Security Fixes and Improvements

This document describes the security fixes and improvements made to the Saros DLMM Rust SDK to address potential panic conditions and improve error handling.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Fixed Panic in Protocol Fee Calculation
**File**: `src/math/utils.rs`
**Issue**: `get_protocol_fee` function used `unwrap()` which could panic on overflow
**Fix**: Replaced with proper error handling using `Result<u64>` return type and checked arithmetic

### 2. Fixed Panic in Price Calculation
**File**: `src/math/bin_math.rs`
**Issue**: `get_price_from_id` function had multiple `unwrap()` calls that could panic
**Fix**: Added input validation and proper error handling with `Result<u128>` return type

### 3. Fixed Panic in Variable Fee Calculation
**File**: `src/state/pair.rs`
**Issue**: Multiple `unwrap()` calls in fee calculations could cause panics
**Fix**: Replaced with proper error handling using `map_err()` for type conversions

### 4. Fixed Unwrap in Transfer Fee Calculation
**File**: `src/lib.rs`
**Issue**: `compute_transfer_fee` calls used `unwrap()` which could panic
**Fix**: Replaced with proper error propagation using `?` operator

### 5. Implemented Missing Swap Function
**File**: `src/lib.rs`
**Issue**: `get_swap_and_account_metas` was unimplemented (had `unimplemented!()`)
**Fix**: Implemented the function to return proper `SwapAndAccountMetas`

## Improvements

### 6. Added Input Validation
- Added zero amount checks in fee calculation functions
- Added bin_step validation to prevent division by zero
- Added overflow checks in arithmetic operations

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling
- Replaced all `unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
- Added new error codes for better error reporting
- Used checked arithmetic operations throughout

### 8. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Added edge case tests for overflow conditions
- Added tests for zero input validation
- Added tests for maximum value scenarios
- Added fuzz testing for mathematical operations

## Test Files Added

- `src/math/utils_tests.rs` - Tests for utility functions
- `src/math/bin_math_tests.rs` - Tests for price calculation functions
- `src/state/pair_tests.rs` - Tests for pair state operations

## Error Codes Added

- `InvalidBinStep` - For invalid bin step values

## Breaking Changes

The following functions now return `Result` types instead of direct values:
- `get_protocol_fee` - Now returns `Result<u64>`
- `get_price_from_id` - Now returns `Result<u128>`

All calling code has been updated to handle these new return types properly.

## Security Impact

These fixes prevent potential panic conditions that could:
1. Crash the entire swap operation
2. Cause unexpected behavior in fee calculations
3. Lead to incorrect price calculations
4. Result in failed swap transactions

The improvements ensure that all mathematical operations are safe and properly handle edge cases without panicking.
